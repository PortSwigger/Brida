<p>This extension works as a bridge between Burp Suite and Frida, lets you use and manipulate applications' own methods
    while tampering the traffic exchanged between the applications and their back-end services/servers.
    It supports all platforms supported by Frida (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX).
</p>

<p>This idea is a need that is born during the analysis of some mobile application that use strong symmetric cryptography using
    random keys, without knowing the correct secret all data was not modifiable via Burp neither with a custom plugin.
    More generally, applications' logic could be based on cryptographic tokens, it could use a complex challenge-response
    algorithm as well, and so on. How can we tamper the messages? Most of the times the only viable approach is to
    decompile/disassemble the application, identify the functions or methods we're interested in AND re-implement them.
    This approach is obviously time consuming and not always really viable: i.e. the generation of tokens and/or the encryption
    routines could be based on cryptographic material strictly tied to the device (state) or stored inside protected areas and
    thus not directly accessible... That's when Brida comes in handy: instead of trying to extract keys/certificates and
    re-writing the routines we're interested in, why don't we let the application do the dirty work for us?
</p>

<p>Brida integrates many different tools that help pentesters during mobile
application analysis, among which an integrated console in which output
from all the Frida and Brida hooks are printed, an integrated JS editor
with JavaScript syntax highlighting and an analysis tab, in which there is
a tree representation of the binary (Java/OBJC classes and methods,
imports/exports) and from which it is possible to graphically add
inspection hooks (that print arguments and return value every time that the
hooked function is executed) and tamper hooks (that dynamically change the
return value of the hooked function every time that it is executed).</p>

<p>Last
version introduces the most recent Frida hooks developed by the community
for Android and iOS platforms to bypass and inspect security features and a
new highly-customizable engine that allows to graphically create custom
plugins to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Process requests/responses that pass through every Burp Suite tool, in
order to be able to encrypt/decrypt/resign elements of requests and
responses using Frida exported functions</li>
	<li>Add custom tab to Burp Suite request/response pane, in order to be able
to decrypt/decode/process requests/responses (or portion of them) using
Frida exported functions (and then encrypt/encode/process modifications and
replacing the original request/response, if any)</li>
	<li>Add custom context menu options to invoke Frida exported functions on
requests and responses</li>
	<li>Add buttons that invoke/enable Frida exported functions</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Python 2.7 or 3 with pyro4 module, frida client and frida-compile</li>
    <li>An iOS or Android device with the frida-server running on it (root
    privileges on the device required) or an application patched with the
        Frida's Gadget (root privileges on the device not required).</li>
</ul>
