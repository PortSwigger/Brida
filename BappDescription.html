<p>This extension works as a bridge between Burp Suite and Frida, lets you use and manipulate applications' own methods
    while tampering the traffic exchanged between the applications and their back-end services/servers.
    It supports all platforms supported by Frida (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and QNX).
</p>

<p>This idea is a need that is born during the analysis of some mobile application that use strong symmetric cryptography using
    random keys, without knowing the correct secret all data was not modifiable via Burp neither with a custom plugin.
    More generally, applications' logic could be based on cryptographic tokens, it could use a complex challenge-response
    algorithm as well, and so on. How can we tamper the messages? Most of the times the only viable approach is to
    decompile/disassemble the application, identify the functions or methods we're interested in AND re-implement them.
    This approach is obviously time consuming and not always really viable: i.e. the generation of tokens and/or the encryption
    routines could be based on cryptographic material strictly tied to the device (state) or stored inside protected areas and
    thus not directly accessible... That's when Brida comes in handy: instead of trying to extract keys/certificates and
    re-writing the routines we're interested in, why don't we let the application do the dirty work for us?
</p>

<p>The last version of Brida adds a lot of different tools that help
    pentesters during mobile application analysis, among which an integrated
    console in which output from all the Frida and Brida hooks are printed, an
    integrated JS editor with JavaScript syntax highlighting and an analysis
    tab, in which there is a tree representation of the binary (Java/OBJC
    classes and methods, imports/exports) and from which it is possible to
    graphically add inspection hooks (that print arguments and return value
    every time that the hooked function is executed) and tamper hooks (that
    dynamically change the return value of the hooked function every time that
    it is executed).</p>

<p><b>Requirements:</b></p>

<ul>
    <li>Python 2.7 and the frida and pyro4 modules</li>
    <li>An iOS or Android device with the frida-server running on it (root
    privileges on the device required) or an application patched with the
        Frida's Gadget (root privileges on the device not required).</li>
</ul>
